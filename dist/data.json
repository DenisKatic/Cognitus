        "project_description": "<p> Recent achievements in Deep Learning and its successful practical adoption in a variety of applications (e.g., image classification) suggest that it can also be applied for predicting equipment outages. In production and logistics, which are the application fields of COGNITUS, the need for novel, more effective learning techniques is clearly motivated by the fact that maintenance costs account for between 15% and 40% of total cost. However, three key issues currently prevent Deep Learning techniques from being deployed in real world settings: they lack explainability, it is unclear how to consider algorithmic predictions in maintenance processes and decisions, and pilot studies based on real-world industry datasets are still scarce. </p><p>Therefore, the <b>goal of COGNITUS</b> is to provide a Deep Learning pipeline equipped with a set of generic algorithmic building blocks for predicting outages of machineries based on sensor data streams. It will implement those building blocks for two distinct real-world use cases and predict outages of jewelry production equipment (Swarovski), and warehousing equipment in logistics (SPAR). Orthogonally, COGNITUS will investigate, develop and validate novel data-driven maintenance strategies, which support decision making based on algorithmic predictions. </p><p>The <b>expected results</b> of COGNITUS are: <ul><li>(i) data-driven maintenance and decision support models considering algorithmic predictions in decision making, </li><li>(ii) data analytics and visualization algorithms operating on-top of data streams, </li><li>(iii) software libraries supporting training and evaluation of Deep Learning based outage prediction models and providing explainability of model behaviors and predictions, and </li><li>(iv) two pilot demonstrators in the fields of production and logistics, which allow assessment and quantification of benefits on the operational and business level.</li></ul> </p>",
        "project_description_2":"<p><b>Innovation</b> in COGNITUS is driven by its interdisciplinary nature, which enables the combination of expertise drawn from the fields of data science (AIT, LineMetrics) and maintenance planning (FhA). This will yield novel integrated data science and maintenance planning methods that tackle a number of open scientific and technical challenges: training and deploying Deep Learning models on-top of horizontally scalable data streaming frameworks; exploring and visualizing streaming data; and investigation of probing techniques for studying the inner structure of trained Deep Learning models. COGNITUS will also implement prototypical dashboards and investigate how algorithmic predictions can be communicated to the end user while outperforming existing maintenance software solutions in terms of user experience. </p><p>Maintenance experts and decision makers, who face the challenge of minimizing unscheduled outages in their daily work, form the <b>target user group</b> that benefits directly from COGNITUS project results. They will receive automated outage predictions without having to invest much effort in manual feature engineering. They can visually inspect system behaviors in near real-time sensor data streams, and they can rely on tailored maintenance processes that define how to react and decide upon algorithmic outage predictions. Those direct user benefits should also yield higher-level business benefits in terms of less unscheduled outages leading to increased supply chain security and higher overall equipment effectiveness, which can be increased by up to 25% in both application use cases."

        "part_1": "An outage is a generic notion for interruption in use or functioning and can have a variety of specific manifestations across industries and application fields: in <b>production</b>, which is one application field of COGNITUS, a typical outage affects machineries or machine parts and therefore has negative effects on the quality, stability, and availability of the production system; in <b>logistics</b>, which is the other application field of this project, an outage of warehousing equipment can disrupt entire supply chains; in both fields, an outage typically triggers field-specific form of <b>maintenance activities</b> that follow certain processes and decision-making strategies.",

The application of <b>prediction techniques</b> in production systems including equipment, machineries and physical assets will be the <b>most important application area of Industrial Analytics</b> (79% of percent of respondents) within the upcoming three years (Lueth et al., 2016). In line with this fact, approximately 60% of the respondents emphasize on developing knowledge-based decision-support systems to improve efficiency and effectiveness of industrial processes, i.e. using data from operation to automate maintenance planning decisions (Lueth et al., 2016).</p><p> Bousdekis et al. (2015) reviewed an extensive body of literature on prognostic-based decision support for CBM and provided a practical technique to effectively identify and select appropriate combinations of methods, including different data-driven approaches. (cf. Bousdekis et al., 2015). <i>However, those approaches heavily rely on manual investigation and identification of possible failure characteristics and subsequent feature engineering.</i></p>",

        "part_1": "<p>In recent years, a number of machine learning approaches emerged that aim at predicting future equipment outages based on historical data. At the moment, most deployed approaches rely on statistical models that were trained on manually defined and extracted feature sets, which is a labor-intensive task requiring extensive domain knowledge. A possible alternative supporting automated feature identification is <b>Deep Learning</b>, which has shown superior performance on a variety of applications such as image and audio classification, or speech and handwriting recognition. It is becoming increasingly clear that Deep Learning models can also be applied for predicting outages and thereby reduce manual feature engineering effort by constructing relevant features automatically.</p><p> However, three key issues currently prevent Deep Learning models from being deployed in real-world industry settings: first, when models are trained for specific tasks, it usually remains unclear how they learn and why they deliver a certain performance. Thus, they <b>lack explainability of algorithmic behaviors</b>, which is key requirement for acceptance in many industries. Second, it is yet largely unclear how <b>data-driven maintenance processes and decision-making</b> strategies can be employed in practical industry settings. Third, potential operational and business benefits cannot yet be assessed because of pilot studies using real-world industry datasets are scarce.</p>",

    "maintenance":{
        "part_1": "<p>An emerging trend in the maintenance literature is knowledge-based decision support approaches for predictive maintenance. In order to develop a maintenance analyticbased decision support solution, the need of an overarching approach has been indicated, which should combine modeling of data, knowledge and context (Karim et al., 2016). Mourtzis et al. (2017) proposed a methodology for knowledge-based estimation of maintenance time, based on monitoring of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) using a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) technique. The proposed approach supports knowledge capturing and reuse in maintenance activities within Product Service Systems (PSS). Moreover, Miebach et al. (2017) presented a method to design a self-learning maintenance library using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), for selecting the right maintenance measures at the right time.</p>",
